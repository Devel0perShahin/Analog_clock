# Analog_clock

This Analog Clock Is Written By Pure HTML, CSS, And JavaScript, With No Frameworks, And 100% Handwritten Code. 
I Also Want To Say With Glad The Clock Is 100% Responsive For Any Height And Any Width. 
The Clock Automatically Detects Height And Width And Then Manages Self-Height. 
So You Can Say This Is A Smart Analog Clock
